# Todo App

This is a small **todo app** I made as a side project.  
The idea was to keep it **simple, minimal, and modern-looking** without adding a ton of extra stuff.

## Features

- Add new tasks  
- Set timelines or deadlines  
- Delete or mark tasks as done  
- Manage your list in a clean, standalone app  

Nothing fancy â€” just a **lightweight tool** to keep track of things you need to do, without the clutter.
